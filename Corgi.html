        <h2>Corgi Poem</h2>
        <P>In fair Corgi-land, where tails doth wag, A noble breed, in stature not too sag, With fur so soft and eyes so bright, They prance and play in morning's light.</P>
        <p>Yet hidden deep within this playful scene, A message about society, so keen, For in these tiny, loyal hounds we find, A lesson 'bout the human heart and mind.</p>
        <p>In Corgis, unity is plain to see, No prejudice, no bias, only glee, Their colors vary, some with spots or stripes, Yet love and friendship truly are the types.</p>
        <p>In our own world, diversity we prize, Yet sometimes our judgment blinds our eyes, We see the surface, not the soul within, Forgetting that true worth lies deep within.</p>
        <p>Let Corgis teach us, in their charming way, That in our hearts, compassion ought to sway, To judge not by appearances alone, But cherish each unique and precious stone.</p>
        <p>So, when you see a Corgi's happy face, Remember, in this world, we all have a place, And hidden in their playfulness so dear, Lies a message for a society sincere.</p>
